Quiet buttons are used sparingly and for an optional action. Mainly used in internal applications like My TELUS (web and app) or Casa; it only comes in one variant and size.

### Usage criteria

- Use for interactions that are not necessarily mandatory
- Use for enhanced experience where if the button does not exist, the customer can still do what they need to
- Keep the text short and precise, recommendation is text that describes an action (Ie. Copy, Edit, Print)
- Make use of the A11yContent core component to provide more written context for assistive technology users for when they navigate a page using only button landmarks
- Buttons should not be disabled

#### QuietButton with Icons

- Only dependent icons can be added into buttons, they can be on the left or right of the label
- The colour of the text and icon have to be the same

```jsx
<QuietButton>Hello World!</QuietButton>
```
